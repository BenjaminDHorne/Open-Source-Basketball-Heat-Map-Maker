This program was used in the paper "From Sports to Science: Using Basketball Analytics to Broaden the Appeal of Math and Science Among Youth" at MIT Sports Analytics Conference 2017. This version was used as a proof of concept, our online version is here: https://github.com/BenjaminDHorne/basketball_heatmaps 

Please read this before getting started.

1. To use the heatmap generator you must first run install.bat (right-click and run as administrator)
This will install everything you need!

2. Use the input.csv file to enter the shooting data. This can be opened with excel or notepad (preferably excel).
The format is as follows:

Position Number, Make, Attempt

The floor positions that coorespond to the position numbers in input.csv can be found in floor_positions.png 

3. Once data is entered into input.csv, save the file and double click GenerateHeatMap.py
After about a minute a heatmap plot of your data will pop up. You can save the image using the save icon on the bottom of the pop up.


Enjoy

If you want to modify the code, you are welcome to. There are actually many more heatmap options in the code, simply read the comments!
